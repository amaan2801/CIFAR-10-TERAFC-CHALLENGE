# CIFAR-10-TERAFC-CHALLENGE
This project implements a level-wise image classification pipeline on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch and ResNet-18 transfer learning. The work is structured into four progressive levels, demonstrating improvements through fine-tuning, data augmentation, architectural customization, interpretability, and ensemble learning.
